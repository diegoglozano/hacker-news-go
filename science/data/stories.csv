46820691,"Hi HN<p>I’m building ÆTHRA — a programming language designed specifically for composing music and emotional soundscapes.<p>Instead of focusing on general-purpose programming, ÆTHRA is a pure DSL where code directly represents musical intent: tempo, mood, chords, progression, dynamics, and instruments.<p>The goal is to make music composition feel closer to writing a story or emotion, rather than manipulating low-level audio APIs.<p>Key ideas:
- Text-based music composition
- Chords and progressions as first-class concepts
- Time, tempo, and structure handled by the language
- Designed for ambient, cinematic, emotional, and minimal music
- Interpreter written in C# (.NET)<p>Example ÆTHRA code (simplified):<p>tempo 60
instrument guitar<p>chord Am for 4
chord F for 4
chord C for 4
chord G for 4<p>This generates a slow, melancholic progression suitable for ambient or cinematic scenes.<p>ÆTHRA currently:
- Generates WAV audio
- Supports notes, chords, tempo, duration, velocity
- Uses a simple interpreter (no external DAWs or MIDI tools)
- Is intentionally minimal and readable<p>What it is NOT:
- Not a DAW replacement
- Not MIDI-focused<p>Why I made it:
I wanted a language where music is the primary output — not an afterthought. Something between code, emotion, and sound design.<p>The project is open-source and early-stage (v0.8). I’m mainly looking for:
- Feedback on the language design
- Ideas for musical features worth adding
- Thoughts from people into PL design, audio, or generative art<p>Repo: &lt;<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;TanmayCzax&#x2F;AETHRA"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;TanmayCzax&#x2F;AETHRA</a>&gt;<p>Thanks for reading — happy to answer questions or discuss ideas.",44,,1769749177,CzaxTanmay,Show HN: ÆTHRA – Writing Music as Code,12

46812285,"We’re Maria and Jonatan, a married couple running a small music night in Norrköping, Sweden, called Kolibri.<p>It’s not a software project. We run it through our own small Swedish company, pay artists, and do the operations ourselves. We do one night a month (usually the last Friday) in a restaurant venue called Mitropa. A typical night is about 50–70 paying guests. The first years it was DJs only, but last year we started doing live bands as well.<p>We made a simple site with schedule plus photos&#x2F;video so you can see what it looks like:
<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kolibrinkpg.com&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kolibrinkpg.com&#x2F;</a><p>On the site:<p><pre><code>  * photos and short videos (size&#x2F;atmosphere)

  * the kind of acts we book (post-punk, darkwave, synth, adjacent electronic)

  * enough context to copy parts of the format if you’re building something similar locally

  * for the tech-curious: we built our own ticketing system (first used in February) and a media ingestion pipeline for Instagram and external photographers
</code></pre>
How it started was accidental. I was doing remote music sessions with a friend in London (Ableton projects back and forth on FaceTime), ran out of beer, and walked into the nearest place. I got talking to Nahir, who runs Mitropa, and floated the idea of running a DIY music night there. He was up for it.<p>What made it take off was doing things in person. People will show up alone if they trust the room. Maria ended up doing a lot of that work: greeting newcomers, noticing who looks uncertain, and setting a tone where people treat each other decently.<p>Maria didn’t come from a DJ background. Klubbvärdinnan started as a joke name at Kolibri and then became her DJ moniker. She got good quickly, and after a first gig outside our own night she started getting booked elsewhere too.<p>Marketing-wise, what worked best was very analogue: walking around town, visiting local businesses we genuinely like, buying something, introducing ourselves, and asking if we could leave a flyer.<p>In the beginning we weren’t sure how to present it on social media. So we filmed headphone walks: one person walking through town listening to a track we picked. It looked good, people wanted to be in them, and afterwards we’d buy them a couple of drinks and actually talk. That turned a social media interaction into a real connection. It was a bit of luck, but it worked.<p>Questions welcome about what worked, what failed, costs&#x2F;logistics, and what we’d do differently if we started over.",140,https://kolibrinkpg.com/,1769703559,EastLondonCoder,"Show HN: Kolibri, a DIY music club in Sweden",30

46833754,"I got really interested in biology and genetics a few months ago, just for fun.<p>This was largely inspired by the work of Sydney Brenner, which became the basis of my brennerbot.org project.<p>In particular, I became very fascinated by phages, which are viruses that attack bacteria. They&#x27;re the closest thing to the &quot;fundamental particles&quot; of biology: the minimal units of genetic code that do something useful that allows them to reproduce and spread.<p>They also have some incredible properties, like having a structure that somehow encodes an icosahedron.<p>I always wondered how the DNA of these things translated into geometry in the physical world. That mapping between the &quot;digital&quot; realm of ACGT, which in turn maps onto the 20 amino acids in groups of 3, and the world of 3D, analog shapes, still seems magical and mysterious to me.<p>I wanted to dig deeper into the subject, but not by reading a boring textbook. I wanted to get a sense for these phages in a tangible way. What are the different major types of phages? How do they compare to each other in terms of the length and structure of their genetic code? The physical structure they assume?<p>I decided to make a program to explore all this stuff in an interactive way.<p>And so I&#x27;m very pleased to present you with my open-source Phage Explorer:<p>phage-explorer.org<p>I probably went a bit overboard, because what I ended up with has taken a sickening number of tokens to generate, and resulted in ~150k lines of Typescript and Rust&#x2F;Wasm.<p>It implements 23 analysis algorithms, over 40 visualizations, and has the complete genetic data and 3D structure of 24 different classes of phage.<p>It actually took a lot of engineering to make this work well in a browser; it&#x27;s a surprising amount of data (this becomes obvious when you look at some of the 3D structure models).<p>It works fairly well on mobile, but if you want to get the full experience, I highly recommend opening it on a desktop browser in high resolution.<p>As far as I know, it&#x27;s the most complete informational &#x2F; educational software about phages available anywhere. Now, I am the first to admit that I&#x27;m NOT an expert, or even that knowledgeable, about, well, ANY of this stuff.<p>So if you’re a biology expert, please take a look and let me know what you think of what I&#x27;ve made! And if I&#x27;ve gotten anything wrong, please let me know in the GitHub Issues and I&#x27;ll fix it:<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Dicklesworthstone&#x2F;phage_explorer"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Dicklesworthstone&#x2F;phage_explorer</a>",121,https://phage-explorer.org/,1769836923,eigenvalue,Show HN: Phage Explorer,32

We’re not talking about AI for your email, this is email for your AI.<p>Email is an optimal interface for long-running agents. It’s multithreaded and asynchronous with full support for rich text and files. It’s a universal protocol with identity and authentication built in. Moreover, a lot of workflow critical context already lives in email.<p>We wanted to build email agents that you can forward your work to and get back a completed task. The agents could act entirely autonomously as you wouldn&#x27;t need to delegate your identity. If they did get stuck they could just send you, or anyone else, an email.<p>Using Gmail, we kept getting stuck on the limitations of their API. No way to create inboxes programmatically. Rate and sending limits. OAuth for every single inbox. Keyword search that doesn&#x27;t understand context. Per-seat pricing that doesn&#x27;t work for agents.<p>So we built what we wished existed: an email provider for developers. APIs for creating inboxes and configuring domains. Email parsing and threading. Text extraction from attachments. Realtime webhooks and websockets. Semantic search across inboxes. Usage-based pricing that works for agents.<p>Developers, startups, and enterprises are already deploying email agents with AgentMail. Agents that convert conversations and documents into structured data. Agents that source quotes, negotiate prices, and get the best deals. Agents that emulate internet users for training models on end-to-end tasks.<p>Here&#x27;s demo of Clawdbots communicating using AgentMail: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;Y0MfUWS3LKQ"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;Y0MfUWS3LKQ</a><p>You can get started with AgentMail for free at <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;agentmail.to"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;agentmail.to</a><p>Looking forward to hearing your thoughts and feedback.",169,,1769704953,Haakam21,Launch HN: AgentMail (YC S25) – An API that gives agents their own email inboxes,167

46784221,"Hi HN, I&#x27;ve been building Mystral Native — a lightweight native runtime that lets you write games in JavaScript&#x2F;TypeScript using standard Web APIs (WebGPU, Canvas 2D, Web Audio, fetch) and run them as standalone desktop apps. Think &quot;Electron for games&quot; but without Chromium. Or a JS runtime like Node, Deno, or Bun but optimized for WebGPU (and bundling a window &#x2F; event system using SDL3).<p>Why: I originally started by starting a new game engine in WebGPU, and I loved the iteration loop of writing Typescript &amp; instantly seeing the changes in the browser with hot reloading. After getting something working and shipping a demo, I realized that shipping a whole browser doesn&#x27;t really work if I also want the same codebase to work on mobile. Sure, I could use a webview, but that&#x27;s not always a good or consistent experience for users - there are nuances with Safari on iOS supporting WebGPU, but not the same features that Chrome does on desktop. What I really wanted was a WebGPU runtime that is consistent &amp; works on any platform. I was inspired by deno&#x27;s --unsafe-webgpu flag, but I realized that deno probably wouldn&#x27;t be a good fit long term because it doesn&#x27;t support iOS or Android &amp; doesn&#x27;t bundle a window &#x2F; event system (they have &quot;bring your own window&quot;, but that means writing a lot of custom code for events, dealing with windowing, not to mention more specific things like implementing a WebAudio shim, etc.). So that got me down the path of building a native runtime specifically for games &amp; that&#x27;s Mystral Native.<p>So now with Mystral Native, I can have the same developer experience (write JS, use shaders in WGSL, call requestAnimationFrame) but get a real native binary I can ship to players on any platform without requiring a webview or a browser. No 200MB Chromium runtime, no CEF overhead, just the game code and a ~25MB runtime.<p>What it does:
- Full WebGPU via Dawn (Chrome&#x27;s implementation) or wgpu-native (Rust)
- Native window &amp; events via SDL3
- Canvas 2D support (Skia), Web Audio (SDL3), fetch (file&#x2F;http&#x2F;https)
- V8 for JS (same engine as Chrome&#x2F;Node), also supports QuickJS and JSC
- ES modules, TypeScript via SWC
- Compile to single binary (think &quot;pkg&quot;): `mystral compile game.js --include assets -o my-game`
- macOS .app bundles with code signing, Linux&#x2F;Windows standalone executables
- Embedding API for iOS and Android (JSC&#x2F;QuickJS + wgpu-native)<p>It&#x27;s early alpha — the core rendering path works well &amp; I&#x27;ve tested on Mac, Linux (Ubuntu 24.04), and Windows 11, and some custom builds for iOS &amp; Android to validate that they can work, but there&#x27;s plenty to improve. Would love to get some feedback and see where it can go!<p>MIT licensed.<p>Repo: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mystralengine&#x2F;mystralnative"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mystralengine&#x2F;mystralnative</a><p>Docs: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mystralengine.github.io&#x2F;mystralnative&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mystralengine.github.io&#x2F;mystralnative&#x2F;</a>",49,https://github.com/mystralengine/mystralnative,1769538785,Flux159,Show HN: Mystral Native – Run JavaScript games natively with WebGPU (no browser),18

46837885,"Hi HN,<p>I’m Linn, the creator of ToolKuai (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;toolkuai.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;toolkuai.com</a>).<p>Like many of you, I’ve always been wary of &quot;free&quot; online file converters. Most of them are black boxes: you upload your private documents or images to a remote server, and you have no idea where that data ends up or how it’s being used to train models.<p>I wanted to build a suite of tools (Video&#x2F;Image compressor, OCR, AI Background Remover) that runs entirely in the browser. No files ever leave your machine.
The Tech Stack<p>To make this performant enough to rival server-side processing, I leaned heavily into modern web APIs:<p>- AI Background Removal: I&#x27;m using ONNX models (Xenova&#x2F;modnet and ISNet) running locally via Transformers.js. The processing is 100% client-side, fallbacking to WASM when WebGPU isn&#x27;t available.<p>- Frontend: Built with SvelteKit (Svelte 5) for its lean footprint and fast reactivity.<p>- Storage &amp; Delivery: AI models are self-hosted on Cloudflare R2 to avoid massive bandwidth costs and ensure fast delivery.<p>Current Stats (13 days in):<p>The site is only 2 weeks old. Surprisingly, I’ve seen strong organic interest from Taiwan and Hong Kong. Average time on site is currently around 3.5 minutes, which suggests people are actually staying to process multiple files, confirming that the client-side speed is hitting the mark.<p>Future &amp; Monetization<p>The tool is free. I’ve decided to avoid the &quot;Pro&#x2F;Premium&quot; subscription model, as I believe these utility tools should be accessible. I&#x27;m exploring non-intrusive ads to cover the infrastructure costs (mostly R2 and Vercel).<p>I’d love to get some feedback from the HN community on:<p>- Performance on different hardware (especially the WebGPU-based video compressor).<p>- Privacy concerns or suggestions on how to further harden the &quot;No-Server&quot; promise.<p>- Any specific media tools you feel are currently lacking in the &quot;client-side only&quot; ecosystem.<p>Link: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;toolkuai.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;toolkuai.com</a><p>Thanks!",8,https://toolkuai.com/,1769875906,indie_max,"Show HN: ToolKuai – Privacy-first, 100% client-side media tools",1
46779922,"Hi HN,<p>I’m Tullie, founder of Shaped. Previously, I was a researcher at Meta AI, worked on ranking for Instagram Reels, and was a contributor to PyTorch Lightning.<p>We built ShapedQL because we noticed that while retrieval (finding 1,000 items) has been commoditized by vector DBs, ranking (finding the best 10 items) is still an infrastructure problem.<p>To build a decent for you feed or a RAG system with long-term memory, you usually have to put together a vector DB (Pinecone&#x2F;Milvus), a feature store (Redis), an inference service, and thousands of lines of Python to handle business logic and reranking.<p>We built an engine that consolidates this into a single SQL dialect. It compiles declarative queries into high-performance, multi-stage ranking pipelines.<p>HOW IT WORKS:<p>Instead of just SELECT <i>, ShapedQL operates in four stages native to recommendation systems:<p>RETRIEVE: Fetch candidates via Hybrid Search (Keywords + Vectors) or Collaborative Filtering.
FILTER: Apply hard constraints (e.g., &quot;inventory &gt; 0&quot;).
SCORE: Rank results using real-time models (e.g., p(click) or p(relevance)).
REORDER: Apply diversity logic so your Agent&#x2F;User doesn’t see 10 nearly identical results.<p>THE SYNTAX: Here is what a RAG query looks like. This replaces about 500 lines of standard Python&#x2F;LangChain code:<p>SELECT item_id, description, price<p>FROM<p><pre><code>  -- Retrieval: Hybrid search across multiple indexes

  search_flights(&quot;$param.user_prompt&quot;, &quot;$param.context&quot;),

  search_hotels(&quot;$param.user_prompt&quot;, &quot;$param.context&quot;)
</code></pre>
WHERE<p><pre><code>  -- Filtering: Hard business constraints

  price &lt;= &quot;$param.budget&quot; AND is_available(&quot;$param.dates&quot;)
</code></pre>
ORDER BY<p><pre><code>  -- Scoring: Real-time reranking (Personalization + Relevance)

  0.5 * preference_score(user, item) +

  0.3 * relevance_score(item, &quot;$param.user_prompt&quot;)
</code></pre>
LIMIT 20<p>If you don’t like SQL, you can also use our Python and Typescript SDKs. I’d love to know what you think of the syntax and the abstraction layer!</i>",80,https://playground.shaped.ai,1769522049,tullie,Show HN: ShapedQL – A SQL engine for multi-stage ranking and RAG,23

We train interactive avatar video models. Our API lets you upload a photo and immediately jump into a FaceTime-style call with that character. Here&#x27;s a demo: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.loom.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;941577113141418e80d2834c83a5a0a9"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.loom.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;941577113141418e80d2834c83a5a0a9</a><p>Chatbots are everywhere and voice AI has taken off, but we believe video avatars will be the most common form factor for conversational AI. Most people would rather watch something than read it. The problem is that generating video in real-time is hard, and overcoming the uncanny valley is even harder.<p>We haven’t broken the uncanny valley yet. Nobody has. But we’re getting close and our photorealistic avatars are currently best-in-class (judge for yourself: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lemonslice.com&#x2F;try&#x2F;taylor"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lemonslice.com&#x2F;try&#x2F;taylor</a>).

Talking to this little guy may improve your mood.<p>Today we&#x27;re releasing our new model* - Lemon Slice 2, a 20B-parameter diffusion transformer that generates infinite-length video at 20fps on a single GPU - and opening up our API.<p>How did we get a video diffusion model to run in real-time? There was no single trick, just a lot of them stacked together. The first big change was making our model causal. Standard video diffusion models are bidirectional (they look at frames both before and after the current one), which means you can&#x27;t stream.<p>From there it was about fitting everything on one GPU. We switched from full to sliding window attention, which killed our memory bottleneck. We distilled from 40 denoising steps down to just a few - quality degraded less than we feared, especially after using GAN-based distillation (though tuning that adversarial loss to avoid mode collapse was its own adventure).<p>And the rest was inference work: modifying RoPE from complex to real (this one was cool!), precision tuning, fusing kernels, a special rolling KV cache, lots of other caching, and more. We kept shaving off milliseconds wherever we could and eventually got to real-time.<p>We set up a guest playground for HN so you can create and talk to characters without logging in: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lemonslice.com&#x2F;hn"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lemonslice.com&#x2F;hn</a>.

So we built Demonstrate Mode.<p>The idea is simple: You perform your workflow once in a remote browser. Notte records the interactions and generates deterministic automation code.<p>How it works:
- Record clicks, inputs, navigations in a cloud browser
- Compile them into deterministic code (no LLM at runtime)
- Run and deploy on managed browser infrastructure<p>Closest analog is Playwright codegen but:
- Infrastructure is handled (remote browsers, proxies, auth state)
- Code runs in a deployable runtime with logs, retries, and optional agent fallback<p>Agents are great for prototyping and dynamic steps, but for production we usually want versioned code and predictable cost&#x2F;behavior.

46794281,"Hi, everyone!<p>I built SHDL (Simple Hardware Description Language) as an experiment in stripping hardware description down to its absolute fundamentals.<p>In SHDL, there are no arithmetic operators, no implicit bit widths, and no high-level constructs. You build everything explicitly from logic gates and wires, and then compose larger components hierarchically. The goal is not synthesis or performance, but understanding: what digital systems actually look like when abstractions are removed.<p>SHDL is accompanied by PySHDL, a Python interface that lets you load circuits, poke inputs, step the simulation, and observe outputs. Under the hood, SHDL compiles circuits to C for fast execution, but the language itself remains intentionally small and transparent.<p>This is not meant to replace Verilog or VHDL. It’s aimed at: - learning digital logic from first principles - experimenting with HDL and language design - teaching or visualizing how complex hardware emerges from simple gates.<p>I would especially appreciate feedback on: - the language design choices - what feels unnecessarily restrictive vs. educationally valuable - whether this kind of “anti-abstraction” HDL is useful to you.<p>Repo: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rafa-rrayes&#x2F;SHDL"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rafa-rrayes&#x2F;SHDL</a><p>Python package: PySHDL on PyPI<p>To make this concrete, here are a few small working examples written in SHDL:<p>1.

Today it’s only a landing page + short survey (no product yet) to test whether this pain is real.<p>The core idea (2–3 bullets):<p>- Many of us capture tons of useful info (notes&#x2F;links&#x2F;docs), but it rarely becomes shipped work.<p>- Instead of better “organization” (tags&#x2F;folders), I’m exploring an “action engine” that:<p><pre><code>  1.detects what you’re actively targetting&#x2F;working on (“active projects”)

  2.surfaces relevant saved material at the right moment

  3.proposes a concrete next action (ideally pushed into your existing task tool)
</code></pre>
My own “second brain” became a graveyard of good intentions: the organizing tax was higher than the value I got back. I’m trying to validate whether the real bottleneck is execution, not capture.<p>Before writing code, I’m trying to pin down two things:<p>- Project context signals (repo&#x2F;PRs? issues? tasks? calendar? a “project doc”?)<p>- How to close the loop: ingest knowledge → rank against active projects → emit a small set of next-actions into an existing todo tool → learn from outcomes (done&#x2F;ignored&#x2F;edited) and optionally write back the minimal state. The open question: what’s the cleanest feedback signal without creating noise or privacy risk? (explicit ratings vs completion events vs doc-based write-back)<p>What I’m asking from you:<p>1.Where does your “second brain” break down the most?<p>capture &#x2F; organization &#x2F; retrieval &#x2F; execution
(If you can, share a concrete recent example.)<p>2.What best represents “active project context” for you today?<p><pre><code>  task project (Todoist&#x2F;Things&#x2F;Reminders)

  issues&#x2F;boards (GitHub&#x2F;Linear&#x2F;Jira)

  a doc&#x2F;wiki page (Notion&#x2F;Docs)

  calendar

  &quot;in my head&quot;
</code></pre>
Which one would you actually allow a tool to read?<p>3.What’s your hard “no” for an AI that suggests actions from your notes&#x2F;links? (pick 1–2)<p><pre><code>  privacy&#x2F;data retention

  noisy suggestions &#x2F; interruption

  hallucinations &#x2F; wrong suggestions

  workflow change &#x2F; migration cost

  pricing

46823849,"This repository implements a deterministic exclusion engine where governance decisions are treated as a mechanical process rather than a probabilistic one. Candidates exist as stateful objects that accumulate strain under a scheduled constraint pressure. Pressure is applied across explicit phases—nucleation, quenching, and crystallization—and exclusion occurs only when accumulated stress exceeds a fixed yield threshold. Once fractured, a candidate cannot re-enter; history matters.<p>There is no ranking, sampling, or temperature. Given identical inputs, configuration, and substrate, the system always produces bit-identical outputs, verified by repeated hash checks. The implementation explores different elastic modulus formulations that change how alignment and proximity contribute to stress, without changing the deterministic nature of the process. The intent is to examine what governance looks like when exclusion is causal, replayable, and mechanically explainable rather than statistical.

46800484,"I’ve been experimenting with embedding an Claude Code&#x2F;Cursor-style coding agent directly into the browser.<p>At a high level, the agent generates and maintains userscripts and CSS that are re-applied on page load. Rather than just editing DOM via JS in console the agent is treating the page, and the DOM as a file.<p>The models are often trained in RL sandboxes with full access to the filesystem and bash, so they are really good at using it. So to make the agent behave well, I&#x27;ve simulated this environment.<p>The whole state of a page and scripts is implemented as a virtual filesystem hacked on top of browser.local storage. URL is mapped to directories, and the agent starts inside this directory. It has the tools to read&#x2F;edit files, grep around and a fake bash command that is just used for running scripts and executing JS code.<p>I&#x27;ve tested only with Opus 4.5 so far, and it works pretty reliably.
The state of the file system can be synced to the real filesystem, although because Firefox doesn&#x27;t support Filesystem API, you need to manually import the fs contents first.<p>This agent is <i>really</i> useful for extracting things to CSV, but it&#x27;s also can be used for fun.<p>Demo: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;x.com&#x2F;ichebykin&#x2F;status&#x2F;2015686974439608607"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;x.com&#x2F;ichebykin&#x2F;status&#x2F;2015686974439608607</a>",56,https://github.com/chebykinn/browser-code,1769629171,mifydev,Show HN: Cursor for Userscripts,15

46812909,"Hi HN! We’re TensorPool. We help companies access and optimize large scale compute for training foundation models.<p>The Problem<p>It’s been almost a year since we’ve finished YC, and we’ve just crossed 100,000 multinode training GPU hours run on our platform.<p>On those training runs, we’ve seen countless 3am job crashes because of issues like an Xid error from a flaky GPU or an S3 timeout that corrupted a checkpoint save. By the time you wake up and notice, you&#x27;ve lost 8+ hours of compute. You scramble to diagnose the issue, manually restart from the last checkpoint, and hope it doesn&#x27;t happen again. Rinse and repeat.<p>For training runs that take days to weeks, this constant babysitting is exhausting and expensive. The research iteration cycles lost can also make or break a model release (especially for short reservations).<p>What We Built<p>This agent monitors your training jobs and autonomously recovers them when things go wrong. It works with Kubernetes, Slurm, and TensorPool Jobs.<p>We originally built the TensorPool Agent as an internal tool to help us debug failures with our own customers. Over time, we realized its performance was so good that we could automate the entire triage process. We&#x27;re now releasing a public beta for people to use.<p>Best case: The TensorPool Agent detects the failure, diagnoses the root cause, fixes it, and restarts your job from the last checkpoint – all while you sleep ;)<p>Worst case: If the TensorPool agent can&#x27;t fix the issue automatically, it delivers a preliminary RCA and a list of actions it attempted, giving you a head start on debugging.<p>How It Works<p>1) Registration – You provide credentials to your job scheduler via our dashboard. Perms are granted on a whitelist basis; you explicitly control what actions the agent can take.<p>2) Monitoring – The agent continuously monitors your job for failure conditions.<p>3) Recovery – On failure, the agent analyzes logs and attempts to diagnose the issue. If successful, it restarts the job from the last checkpoint and resumes monitoring. If not, you get an alert with full context.<p>Target Failure Modes<p>The agent is specifically designed for runtime errors that occur deep into training, like:<p>- CUDA OOM: Memory leaks, gradient explosions<p>- Xid errors: GPU hardware faults (Xid 79, 63, 48, etc.)<p>- Distributed communication failures: NCCL timeouts, rank failures<p>- Storage I&#x2F;O errors: Checkpoint corruption<p>- Network issues: S3 request timeouts on mounted object storage",12,https://docs.tensorpool.dev/features/agent,1769706091,tsvoboda,Show HN: Autonomous recovery for distributed training jobs,3

Well, as it turns out, most of them are essentially clones of existing software but with a chatbot slapped on top. Because of the error prone nature of AI, any application that leverages it also has to surface all of the controls required to override all of its decisions. So you end up with a traditional software application plus AI.<p>AI promised to transform and even replace software applications, but all it did instead was augment them with an unreliable chatbot.

46796825,"I use Claude Code across multiple projects with different conventions and some shared repos just as it so happens to be the real world. Managing the config files (.claude&#x2F;rules&#x2F;, mcps.json, settings.json) by hand got tedious, so I built a local web UI for it.<p>This one started out as claude-config but migrated to coder-config as I&#x27;m adding others (Gemini, AG, Codex, etc).<p>Main features:
  - Visual editor for rules, permissions, and MCP servers
  - Project registry to switch between codebases
  - &quot;Workstreams&quot; to group related repos (frontend + API + shared libs) with shared context
  - Auto-load workstreams on cd to included folders
  - Also supports Gemini CLI and Codex CLI<p>Install:
  npm install -g coder-config
  coder-config ui         # UI at http:&#x2F;&#x2F;localhost:3333
  coder-config ui install # optionally, autostart on MacOS<p>It can also be installed as a PWA and live in your taskbar.<p>Open source, runs locally, no account needed.
Feedback and contributions welcome!<p>Sorry, haven&#x27;t had any chance to test on other OSes (linux&#x2F;windows)",20,https://github.com/regression-io/coder-config,1769615064,jtr101,"Show HN: Config manager for Claude Code (and others) – rules, MCPs, permissions",0

46827710,"Over the last few weeks, world models have started to feel real for the first time. You can see coherent environments, long rollouts, and increasingly convincing visuals. At the same time, most of these systems are hard to run, hard to integrate, and trade interactivity for scale.<p>We started Overworld because we cared less about producing impressive videos and more about building worlds you can actually inhabit. That means low latency, continuous control, and systems that respond every time you act, not once per prompt.<p>Last week, we released Waypoint 1, a research preview of a real-time diffusion world model that runs locally. Next week, we’re releasing Waypoint 1.1 Small, which is designed to run on modern consumer GPUs and be easy to build on and modify.<p>Waypoint is built from scratch rather than fine-tuned from a large video model. We optimized heavily for control frequency, sparse attention, and fast inference so the system can maintain a persistent world state and respond to input at game-level frame rates. The goal was to make something developers can integrate today, not just watch as a demo.<p>We think this space will move fastest once world models follow a path similar to LLMs: local execution, open tooling, and fast community-driven iteration. Genie and similar systems show what’s possible at a massive scale. Our focus has been on making that future local and accessible.<p>We wrote more about the “immersion gap,” why interactivity matters more than visuals alone, and how we optimized the model in a recent blog post.<p>Code, demos, and release details are here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;over.world&#x2F;blog&#x2F;the-immersion-gap",13,,1769796320,lcastricato,"Waypoint 1.1, a local-first world model for interactive simulation",0

46811701,"I’ve found coding agents to be great at 1&#x2F; finding everything they need across large codebases using only bash commands (grep, glob, ls, etc.) and 2&#x2F; building new things based on their findings (duh).<p>What if, instead of a codebase, the files were all your workplace docs? There was a `Google_Drive` folder, a `Linear` folder, a `Slack` folder, and so on. Over the last week, we put together Craft to test this out.<p>It’s an interface to a coding agent (OpenCode for model flexibility) running on a virtual machine with:
1. your company&#x27;s complete knowledge base represented as directories&#x2F;files (kept in-sync)
2. free reign to write and execute python&#x2F;javascript
3. ability to create and render artifacts to the user<p>Demo: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Hvjn76YSIRY"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Hvjn76YSIRY</a>

Workplace apps also have a natural structure (Slack channels about certain topics, Drive folders for teams, etc.). And since the full metadata of each document can be written to the file, the LLM can define arbitrarily complex filters. At scale, it can write and execute python to extract and filter (and even re-use the verified correct logic later).<p>Put another way, bash + a file system provides a much more flexible and powerful interface than traditional RAG or MCP, which today’s smarter LLMs are able to take advantage of to great effect. This comes especially in handy for aggregation style questions that require considering thousands (or more) documents.<p>Naturally, it can also create artifacts that stay up to date based on your company docs. So if you wanted “a dashboard to check realtime what % of outages were caused by each backend service” or simply “slides following XYZ format covering the topic I’m presenting at next week’s dev knowledge sharing session”, it can do that too.<p>Craft (like the rest of Onyx) is open-source, so if you want to run it locally (or mess around with the implementation) you can.<p>Quickstart guide: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.onyx.app&#x2F;deployment&#x2F;getting_started&#x2F;quickstart"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.onyx.app&#x2F;deployment&#x2F;getting_started&#x2F;quickstart</a>
